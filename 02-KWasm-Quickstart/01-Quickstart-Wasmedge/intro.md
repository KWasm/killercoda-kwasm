### Welcome !

[KWasm.sh](https://kwasm.sh) is an installer for WebAsembly(Wasm) runtimes on Kubernetes. It installes existing Wasm runtimes and configres your Kubernetes while running. To orchestrate the provisioning the KWasm-operator takes care of the provisioning jobs.

In this tutorial you will learn to install the KWasm-operator, deploy a [WasmEdge](https://wasmedge.org/) job, and how to check the results in the logs.

**HAVE FUN**
