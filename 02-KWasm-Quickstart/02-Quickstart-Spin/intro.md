### Welcome !

[KWasm.sh](https://kwasm.sh) is an open source project, with the goal of simplifying the integration of WebAssembly with Kubernetes. It uses existing Wasm runtimes and configures your Kubernetes while running. To orchestrate the provisioning the KWasm-operator takes care of the provisioning jobs.

In this tutorial you will learn to install the KWasm-operator, deploy a [Spin](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/index) pod, and see how you can access the demo via http.

**HAVE FUN**
