### Welcome !

[KWasm.sh](https://kwasm.sh) is an installer for WebAsembly(Wasm) runtimes on Kubernetes. It installes existing Wasm runtimes and configres your Kubernetes while running. To orchestrate the provisioning the KWasm-operator takes care of the provisioning jobs.

In this tutorial you will learn to install the KWasm-operator, deploy a [Spin](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/index) pod, and see how you can access the demo via http.
